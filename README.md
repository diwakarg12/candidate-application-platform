# Candidate Application Platform

## Project Overview

The Candidate Application Platform is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the job search process for job seekers. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing job listings, applying for positions, and managing job applications. This platform is built with a focus on enhancing the user experience through features like job filtering, infinite scrolling, and a responsive design.

## Features

### Job Card

Each job listing is displayed as a card, showcasing essential information such as the job title, company name, location, job description (with an option to expand by clicking on view more), experience required, and an apply button/link. This design ensures that job seekers can quickly assess job opportunities and decide whether to apply.

### Filters

The platform includes filters that allow users to refine job listings based on various criteria, including minimum experience, company name, location, role, and minimum base pay. These filters enable job seekers to narrow down their search to more relevant job opportunities.

### Infinite Scrolling

Implemented to enhance the browsing experience, infinite scroll automatically loads additional job listings as the user scrolls down the page. This feature ensures a seamless and uninterrupted job search experience, eliminating the need for a "Load More" button.

### Responsive design

The platform is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal performance and usability across different devices and screen sizes. This includes mobile devices, making the application accessible to job seekers on the go.

### API Integration

The platform integrates with an external API to fetch job listings. The API supports pagination through limit and offset parameters, allowing for efficient data retrieval and display. The API response includes job details and a total count of jobs, facilitating the implementation of infinite scroll and job filtering.
